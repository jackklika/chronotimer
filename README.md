## Basic Git Usage

### Getting this program on your computer
Follow the directions on the D2L document. It is encouraged to use the command line to manage this git project.

Get the program on your local machine by typing "git clone [GIT URL]". I would type "git clone https://github.com/jackklika/cs361-chromotimer.git" for example.


### Saving your Changes and Pushing

- Fork the program to your own account. [TODO: ADD HOWTO]
- Once you have modified or created a file, type "git add [FILENAME]" to add the file to the group of files you will commit.
- Once you are finished adding the files you would like to commit, type 'git commit -m "MESSAGE HERE"'. The '-m' flag specifies a message you would like to attach to the commit. Use the message to say what you changed or added to the file.
- Once you have committed, push the file by typing 'git push' in the root directory of this application.

### Aids

- At any time, use "git status" to see the status of what git is prepared to add or commmit.
- "git log" shows a history of the repo 
- Type "man git" to see a reference manual for git. You can find the man pages for git subcommands such as "git commit" by typing "man git-commit".
